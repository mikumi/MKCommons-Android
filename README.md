MKCommons-Android
=================

While I don't mind sharing the code, this is mostly a personal collecton of random stuff that I pretty often. You won't find much documentation or an overview here, and lots of the stuff is also pretty old. 

I want to extract the code that I need frequently into separate libraries, but well... you know how it works. One day ;-)
